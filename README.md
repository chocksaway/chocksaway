**Pragmatic Software Engineer and Trainer**

RESTful API development,  implementing micro-services using Java 9/11, Ubuntu Linux, and Docker.

Automation and DevOps advocate *(you don't want to pass it to Ops, unless it's documented, they will pass it gracefully back).*

Love "Getting Started" demos and tutorials, which are running in thirty minutes :) 

- ðŸ”­ My current side-project is developing an Art website for my father.  Intuitive, which will "generate" a static site.  With full infrastructure automation.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning The Go Programming Language.
- ðŸŒ± Love Lucene, and RabbitMQ.   
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **C**ycling, **Hector** the camper, **P**hotography, *and stuff which just works*.
